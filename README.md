# Tumor-Classification-from-MRI-images
Collaborated with a group of 5 members to develop a complete recognition system for classifying whether the input image represents a normal brain or the presence of a tumour. 
Handled using the system at different times without losing the data by extracting features and matrices and saving them in files. 
Applied the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Implementation.
